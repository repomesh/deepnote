## Greater security with Snowflake OAuth

With Snowflake OAuth you can give every member of your Deepnote workspace their own set of credentials. You can ensure higher security by using short-lived tokens and enabling the use of multi-factor authentication. Follow the principle of least privilege and use granular access control for various Snowflake resources to ensure everyone can only access the data they need.

The integration leverages [Snowflake's built-in OAuth service](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/user-guide/oauth-snowflake-overview) to provide the authentication using a [custom client integration](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/user-guide/oauth-custom).

<Callout status="info">
To use Snowflake OAuth, you require `SYSADMIN` or `SECURITYADMIN` privileges in Snowflake.

### Creating the integration

This section provides step by step instructions for setting up Snowflake OAuth authentication for use in Deepnote.

1. Please navigate to the Snowflake console (i.e., Snowsight) and create a security integration by running this code:

   ```
   create security integration oauth_deepnote
       type=oauth
       enabled=true
       oauth_client=CUSTOM
       oauth_client_type='CONFIDENTIAL'
       oauth_redirect_uri='https://deepnote.com/auth/snowflake/native-callback'
       oauth_issue_refresh_tokens=true
       oauth_refresh_token_validity=86400;
   ```

2. Run the following code and note the Client ID returned in the output. We will refer to it as `OAUTH_CLIENT_ID` in the following steps.

   ```
   describe security integration oauth_deepnote;
   ```

3. Run the following code to print the Client Secret. We will refer to it as `OAUTH_CLIENT_SECRET` in subsequent steps.

   ```
   select system$show_oauth_client_secrets('OAUTH_DEEPNOTE');
   ```

4. After heading back to Deepnote, create a Snowflake integration as described in our main [Snowflake docs](snowflake).

5. Select **Snowflake OAuth** as the authentication method and enter your `OAUTH_CLIENT_ID` and `OAUTH_CLIENT_SECRET` into the **Client ID** and **Client Secret** fields, respectively.

6. Lastly, click "Create integration".

<Callout status="info">
- If you leave the **Role** empty, Snowflake will use the default role assigned to each user. If you enter a role, Deepnote will use that role when signing in every user using OAuth.
- Snowflake doesn’t allow the following roles to log in via OAuth: `ACCOUNTADMIN`, `ORGADMIN`, `SECURITYADMIN`. Make sure you assign a different role to users when using this authentication method.
</Callout>

### AWS PrivateLink

If your Snowflake instance is configured to use [AWS PrivateLink](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/user-guide/admin-security-privatelink), add the suffix “.privatelink” to the account name. For example, in the Snowflake Deepnote integration settings, your account name would appear as `abc12345.us-east-1.privatelink`.

Deepnote will use the private URL when redirecting users to the SSO screen and the standard URL (without the “.privatelink” suffix) when executing queries and exchanging tokens.

### Using the the Snowflake OAuth integration

In order to use the integration, every user will have to authenticate using their own Snowflake account. They can do it either by pressing the button on a SQL block with this integration, in the three-dot menu of the integration in the right sidebar, or by responding to a prompt when they execute a SQL block.

When you create an app from a notebook that uses the integration, every app user will need to authenticate with their own account. They will be prompted to sign in using Snowflake OAuth during the execution of the app. The results they see will depend on the permissions they have.

<Callout status="info">
- User authentication is also required to browse the Snowflake schema.
- Scheduled notebooks can use a Snowflake OAuth integration: scheduled runs authenticate with the OAuth tokens of the user who set up the schedule. Because those tokens can expire or be revoked, scheduled runs may fail unexpectedly — for reliable scheduling, create a Snowflake integration with username and password as the authentication method instead.
