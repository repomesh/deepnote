## What is a notebook in Deepnote?

Beyond being a powerful computational medium, Deepnote notebooks are fully collaborative documents. They combine SQL, Python, and no-code tools into an analytics environment suitable for data teams.

### Composing with building blocks

Notebooks are made up of a series of blocks. Each major type of content or action you can perform has its own block type:

- Code blocks enable you to write and execute Python code (or [other languages](https://deepnote.com/docs/running-your-own-kernel)).
- [SQL blocks](https://deepnote.com/docs/sql-cells) are used to write SQL queries against databases, pandas DataFrames, and CSV files.
- [Text blocks](https://deepnote.com/docs/text-editing) allow you to compose richly formatted text.
- [Chart blocks](https://deepnote.com/docs/chart-blocks) provide you with a point-and-click charting tool for efficient data visualizations.
- [Input blocks](https://deepnote.com/docs/input-blocks) are interactive widgets that capture user inputs and pass them as variables to your Python code and SQL queries.
- [Big number blocks](https://deepnote.com/docs/big-number-blocks) highlight a single key metric front and center in your dashboards and apps.
- Pivot table blocks let you summarize and cross-tabulate your data without writing code.
- Agent blocks run an AI agent step inside your notebook and can use your connected MCP integrations.

Blocks can easily be added to your notebook via the **add block** (**+**) menu or by selecting a block category from the bottom of your notebook.

### Executing blocks to generate results

In order to see output from your code, you need to execute the corresponding block. You can do this in three ways:

- Click the **Run notebook** button at the top of the notebook. This will execute all blocks from top to bottom. Execution will stop at any block that produces an error.
- Click the **Run** button on the block's sidebar menu.
- Press **Cmd/Ctrl** + **Enter** on your keyboard while focused on a block.

### Exploring helpful block operations

You can access a set of standard block operations in the block's sidebar menu. Besides executing them, you can also comment, share, and delete blocks. Even more options are available in the **block actions** menu, including duplicating or moving blocks up and down. You can also reorder blocks by dragging the handle on the left-hand side of a block. Options can be specific to the given block type, so it’s always worth exploring this menu.

### Changing the working directory of a notebook

By default, the working directory of your notebook is the same as the root of the file system in the right sidebar. Its absolute path is `/work`. To change a notebook's working directory, click its context menu, scroll down to **WORKING DIRECTORY** and click the ⚙️ symbol.

If you have [imported a Jupyter notebook](https://deepnote.com/docs/importing-and-exporting-jupyter-notebooks) and you want to execute it, make sure you place it in the dedicated **Notebooks** section. Jupyter files that exist in the **Files** section are "read-only."
